IO examples.

Using file IO, from the docs:
    "The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second
    argument is another string containing a few characters describing 
    the way in which the file will be used. mode can be: 
        'r' when the file will only be read, 
        'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),
        'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. 
        'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. 
    The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if it's omitted."
